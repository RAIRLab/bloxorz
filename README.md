# Generate Problems

The problem generator will use problem generator scripts located in the `level_gen` directory to create problem instances for testing planners. Each generator script corresponds to a specific type of problem instance. Problem generators create ascii files representing Bloxorz levels, which can be found in the `levels` directory after generation. These ascii levels are then fed into a pddl generator to create PDDL problem files associated with the base adl domain file located in `domain2.pddl`. This domain file and the generated problem files are then fed into `adl2strips` to be ground into STRIPS format for use by planners. 
```bash
generate_problems.py
```

# Solve Problems
The `solve.py` script is used to run various planners on the generated problem instances. It supports multiple planners and can be configured to run specific planners or all available planners. The results, including time taken, expanded states, and plan length, are recorded in a CSV file for analysis.
```bash
solve.py
```

# Plot results
The `plot.py` script is used to visualize the results obtained from running planners on the problem instances. It reads the CSV file generated by `solve.py` and creates plots to compare the performance of different planners across various problem instances.
```bash
plot.py
```
